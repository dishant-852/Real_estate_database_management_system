# Real Estate Database Management System (DBMS)

## Overview
This project implements a Database Management System (DBMS) tailored for a real estate office, specializing in the buying, selling, and renting of properties within a city. The system facilitates storing and managing data related to agents, property details, sales, and rentals.

## Features
- **Data Population**: Generation of test data to populate the database, ensuring interesting and non-trivial queries.
- **Queries**: Implementation and execution of essential queries to demonstrate the functionality of the database, including queries to list properties, find addresses, compute averages, etc.
- **Interfaces**:
  - Database administrator interface: Accessible via SQL command line, allowing administrative tasks and query execution.
  - Real estate office interface: Provides sales reports for each agent, rental property details, etc.
  - Agent interface: Enables agents to update the database when properties are rented or sold.
  
## Deliverables
- **ER Diagram**: A visual representation of the conceptual design of the database, with annotations and assumptions.
- **Relational Design**: SQL tables along with primary and foreign keys, showcasing the refined relational model.
- **Database Administrator Interface**: A functional interface allowing execution of all required queries.
- **Real Estate Office and Agent Interfaces**: Demos of interfaces tailored for real estate office usage and agent interaction.
