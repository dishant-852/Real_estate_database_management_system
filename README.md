Overview
This project implements a Database Management System (DBMS) tailored for a real estate office, specializing in the buying, selling, and renting of properties .The system facilitates storing and managing data related to agents, property details, sales, and rentals.

Features
E-R Model: An Entity-Relationship (E-R) diagram representing the conceptual design of the database.
Relational Model: Conversion of the E-R design into a refined relational model, with tables created in MySQL along with appropriate indices and constraints.
Data Population: Generation of test data to populate the database, ensuring interesting and non-trivial queries.
Queries: Implementation and execution of essential queries to demonstrate the functionality of the database, including queries to list properties, find addresses, compute averages, etc.
Interfaces:
Database administrator interface: Accessible via SQL command line, allowing administrative tasks and query execution.
Real estate office interface: Provides sales reports for each agent, rental property details, etc.
Agent interface: Enables agents to update the database when properties are rented or sold.
Deliverables
ER Diagram: A visual representation of the conceptual design of the database, with annotations and assumptions.

Database Administrator Interface: A functional interface allowing execution of all required queries.
Real Estate Office and Agent Interfaces: Demos of interfaces tailored for real estate office usage and agent interaction.
